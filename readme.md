Welcome to my fireside for Boise Code Work's full stack immersive program on emmet abbreviations and css parallax images.
We use the emmet documentation - https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/ - in order to learn how to write all of the html for the body 
  of this project in just one line.
We also use the background-attached css property on our background images to generate a parallax affect.
You can check out the final product of this short lesson here - https://porterwilcox.github.io/fireside-emmet-parallax/
